Task 1: For Loop

    Create for_loop.sh that:
        Loops through a list of 5 fruits and prints each one
```
$ vim for_loop.sh

#!/bin/bash
for fruits in apple banana jackfruit grapes orange:
do
        echo "$fruits"
done

$ chmod 764 for_loop.sh
$ ./for_loop.sh
````
    Create count.sh that:
        Prints numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop

```
$ vim count.sh

#!/bin/bash
for ((i=1; i<=10; i++))
do
        echo "$i"
done

$ chmod +x count.sh
$ ./count.sh
```

Task 2: While Loop

    Create countdown.sh that:
        Takes a number from the user
        Counts down to 0 using a while loop
        Prints "Done!" at the end

Task 3: Command-Line Arguments

    Create greet.sh that:
        Accepts a name as $1
        Prints Hello, <name>!
        If no argument is passed, prints "Usage: ./greet.sh "

    Create args_demo.sh that:
        Prints total number of arguments ($#)
        Prints all arguments ($@)
        Prints the script name ($0)

Task 4: Install Packages via Script

    Create install_packages.sh that:
        Defines a list of packages: nginx, curl, wget
        Loops through the list
        Checks if each package is installed (use dpkg -s or rpm -q)
        Installs it if missing, skips if already present
        Prints status for each package

    Run as root: sudo -i or sudo su

Task 5: Error Handling

    Create safe_script.sh that:
        Uses set -e at the top (exit on error)
        Tries to create a directory /tmp/devops-test
        Tries to navigate into it
        Creates a file inside
        Uses || operator to print an error if any step fails

Example:

mkdir /tmp/devops-test || echo "Directory already exists"

    Modify your install_packages.sh to check if the script is being run as root — exit with a message if not.
